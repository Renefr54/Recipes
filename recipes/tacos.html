  <h2>This recipe is <strong>perfect</strong> if you would like to eat some delicious tacos</h2>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <h4>For the Pork</h4>
    <!--Recipe begins here-->
  <ul>
    <li>2 ancho chiles, seeds and stems removed</li>
    <li>2 pasilla chiles</li>
    <li>Chicken stock</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>When serving</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 small pineapple cut into quarters</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely diced</li>
    <li>32 - 48 corn tortillas</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place chiles in a large saucepan over medium high heat and cook, turning chiles occasionally, until puffed, pliable, lightly browned in spots, and very aromatic, about 5 minutes. Add chicken stock (it should boil immediately), then pour contents of pan into a small bowl. Cover loosely and set aside.</li>
    <li>Wipe out saucepan, add oil, and return to medium-high heat until oil is shimmering. Add cumin, oregano, and achiote and cook, stirring frequently, until aromatic but not browned, about 30 seconds. Add chipotle chiles and sauce and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds longer. Add vinegar, salt, and sugar and remove from heat. </li>
    <li>Scrape contents of saucepan into a blender along with garlic and chiles with their soaking liquid. Blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as necessary. Set sauce aside to cool slightly. </li>
    <li>Using a very sharp chef's knife or slicing knife, slice pork sirloin as thin as possible. If necessary, place meat in freezer for 15 minutes to firm it up. Split the sides of a heavy duty zipper-lock bag. Place one slice of meat inside bag and pound with the bottom of a heavy 8-inch skillet or a meat pounder until less than 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with remaining meat. </li>
    <li>Add marinade to bowl and toss with hands until every piece of meat is evenly coated in marinade. </li>
    <li>Line the bottom of a disposable aluminum loaf pan with bacon. Add a layer of thin-sliced marinated meat. Continue layering in bacon and meat until all the meat is used up. (It may pile above the pan a little bit. This is ok.) Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 36. </li>
  </ol>
